# Planning

Execution scope came directly from Proposal 4 in:
- `market_research/ambitious_paper_questions/theory_first_low_compute_proposals.md`

Executed work products (completed):
- Non-identifiability construction under unrestricted latent confounding.
- Identifiability restoration analyses under:
  - intervention sufficiency,
  - two-environment invariance assumptions,
  - anchor-variable adjustment.
- Practical evidence checklist for mechanistic claim strength.
- Adversarial synthetic benchmark suite (heavy tails, nonlinear interaction, measurement error, selection bias, and mechanism-shift stress).
- Cross-tissue real-data sanity diagnostics on existing `processed.h5ad` artifacts.
- Full manuscript draft and appendix in `reports/`.

Out of scope:
- Any heavy model retraining.
- Any large extraction sweep.
- Any claim of biological edge truth from toy simulations.


## Agent Completion Tracking
- Do this for your project: `tracking/prompt.md`.
- When you finish meaningful work, update `tracking/prompt.md` with the project status (progress, decisions, blockers, and next step).
- Skip the update only if nothing meaningful changed.
