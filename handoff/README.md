# Handoff

Open follow-ups:
- Convert the markdown manuscript to target venue format (LaTeX + bibliography + line-numbered appendix).
- Add bootstrap uncertainty intervals for tissue-edge `beta_hat` estimates.
- Extend diagnostics to perturbation-derived effects (beyond expression-slope proxies).
- Run sensitivity sweeps on pass thresholds (`R^2`, `RMSE`, pairwise-beta SD) and report stability.


## Agent Completion Tracking
- Do this for your project: `tracking/prompt.md`.
- When you finish meaningful work, update `tracking/prompt.md` with the project status (progress, decisions, blockers, and next step).
- Skip the update only if nothing meaningful changed.
